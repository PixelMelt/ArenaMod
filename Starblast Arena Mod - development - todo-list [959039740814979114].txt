Faster ships have a hard time taking out heavier ships as it is, no need to make it harder


[05-May-22 01:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
But it's going to make them way more powerful than they need to be


[05-May-22 01:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Making your ability the only way to eliminate them


[05-May-22 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Since your base ship will be too weak


[05-May-22 01:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
goliath turret wont help you against a speedster


[05-May-22 01:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
neither will the torpedo


[05-May-22 01:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
with the upcoming torpedo nerf


[05-May-22 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
They absolutely will, the Goliath turret kills anything and the torpedo ability is easy to use


[05-May-22 01:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
you said it yourself in #abilities-info that the goliath turret cant hit small agile ships


[05-May-22 01:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
It can if they're stupid enough to come close


[05-May-22 01:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
And that was before it was buffed 3 times


[05-May-22 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
People enjoy the mod as it is, don't fuck it up


[05-May-22 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
People often complain about things being too confusing and complicated, especially the Turks and frenches


[05-May-22 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't want to follow the same path SBP did


[05-May-22 01:52 AM] Nexagon#6069
will increasing the shield cap or speed of some ships ruin the mod


[05-May-22 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
It absolutely will


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
will that make things more complicated


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
You want BFG to have more health?


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Then leave things as they are


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
The ADF is a glass cannon, not a heavy ship


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
It hits hard, and it can't take too much damage


[05-May-22 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Increasing its shield will make it omnipotent


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
We based every ship of off the ADF and speedster


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Making the ADF any stronger will ruin the balance between all ships


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
i didnt say adf


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
adf can run from attacks


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
its not as slow as goliath


[05-May-22 01:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
or use its recoil bullets


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Besides there is no reason to buff the health of slower ships, they have more energy regen in return for high mass and low speed


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Goliath needs more health, but not adf


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
In that case you should have said Goliath health buff


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Nexagon#6069
thats what ive just told you


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not ALL slower ships


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
No


[05-May-22 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
You said all


[05-May-22 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
You need to realize the sheer magnitude of one "small" change


[05-May-22 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Because that is s game changer


[05-May-22 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or in this case, a total collapse


[05-May-22 01:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
so if i increase advf shield by 5 the mod will be ruined forever


[05-May-22 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well knowing you, you'd do it by 50 points


[05-May-22 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
The adf isn't getting any modifications


[05-May-22 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Every ship has been balanced using the adf


[05-May-22 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
