like in tdm I guess


[02-Apr-22 08:54 AM] Thuliux#9764
so once the control point is added, and can be used to win the game, should we publicise the server?


[02-Apr-22 08:54 AM] Thuliux#9764
since that would be a playable build


[02-Apr-22 08:54 AM] Deleted User#0000

[02-Apr-22 09:06 AM] Nexagon#6069
in the mod code


[02-Apr-22 09:06 AM] Thuliux#9764
we only get a 1.0 build when we get a fully functioning and playable version of the mod


[02-Apr-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[02-Apr-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
what nex is currently adding will be 0.0.1


[02-Apr-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
and when we polish up what he did and make it playable


[02-Apr-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
then it will be 1.0


[02-Apr-22 09:09 AM] Nexagon#6069
what about the name of the mod


[02-Apr-22 09:09 AM] Nexagon#6069

[02-Apr-22 09:10 AM] Nexagon#6069

[02-Apr-22 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
we cannot just make the name the same as his mod


[02-Apr-22 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
we can talk to him


[02-Apr-22 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
and convince him to change the name of his mod


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000

*I wonder who will win*


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
he says his mod is 99% complete


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
whoever releases the mod second, is going to get called a copycat


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
same thing with rumble and tdm


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Thuliux#9764

[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Thuliux#9764
well


[02-Apr-22 09:11 AM] Thuliux#9764
nex says he’s adding this stuff all now


[02-Apr-22 09:12 AM] Thuliux#9764
which means we could put this out today


[02-Apr-22 09:12 AM] Thuliux#9764
and I reckon I could talk to sb main staff to get some promos


[02-Apr-22 09:15 AM] Thuliux#9764
@Deleted User that’s what I mean


[02-Apr-22 09:16 AM] Thuliux#9764

[02-Apr-22 09:16 AM] Deleted User#0000

@Deleted Userthe control point image needs to be correctly scaled


[02-Apr-22 11:45 AM] Nexagon#6069
the edge of the circle should be the edge of the image


[02-Apr-22 11:46 AM] Nexagon#6069
leave the glow in


[02-Apr-22 11:46 AM] Nexagon#6069

[02-Apr-22 11:47 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 04:48 AM] Thuliux#9764
it’s alright I guess


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Thuliux#9764
can you arrange it so that some are on the side too


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Thuliux#9764
and also fill the boxes with like 20-30% opacity colours


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
how do i do that


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
opacity


[03-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Thuliux#9764
pretty sure there’s a fill option


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Thuliux#9764
and the value is a hex


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
i know but how to make it opaque


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Thuliux#9764
the A in RGBA is alpha so do it like that


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Thuliux#9764
alpha is basically opacity


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
i know


[03-Apr-22 04:50 AM] Thuliux#9764
or just look at the SDC code and steal it from there


[03-Apr-22 04:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
doesnt work

[03-Apr-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
make them aligned on the circle


[03-Apr-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000

[03-Apr-22 04:54 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 04:59 AM] Nexagon#6069
do we want to have t6 games and t5 games or games with both


[03-Apr-22 04:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
t6 only for now


[03-Apr-22 04:59 AM] Nexagon#6069
then we dont need pages


[03-Apr-22 05:00 AM] Nexagon#6069
what about the looks


[03-Apr-22 05:00 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 05:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[03-Apr-22 05:00 AM] Nexagon#6069
i can add emoji icons to each ship like in sp if you like


[03-Apr-22 05:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
or make them colored differently


[03-Apr-22 05:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
or is this fine


[03-Apr-22 05:01 AM] Deleted User#0000

great


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
how should ship selecting work


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
would you only be able to select your ship inside your spawn region after 10 seconds


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
when you respawn you have 10 seconds to select a ship


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
or anywhere during 10 seconds


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
or will you be idle in those 10 seconds


[03-Apr-22 05:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
no thats gay


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
you're not idle at all


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
so how do you activate it


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
the ship menu


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
when you respawn


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
there's a button that says "switch ship" below the RCS button


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
but make it big and visible


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
and it stays there 5-10 seconds upon spawning


[03-Apr-22 05:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah make it 5 actually


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
but like that you could switch ships mid fight and get free health


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
if youre fast enough


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
mid fight?


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can get a fast ship and run into the middle


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
but then turn into advf


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you spawn camp that's what you get anyways, so fuck you


[03-Apr-22 05:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
no the switch ship button only appears in the spawn region


[03-Apr-22 05:22 AM] Nexagon#6069
then make a spawn region/base graphic


[03-Apr-22 05:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
for 5 seconds


[03-Apr-22 05:22 AM] Nexagon#6069
just like the point


[03-Apr-22 05:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok lets vc i'll make it


[03-Apr-22 05:24 AM] Nexagon#6069
i did


[03-Apr-22 05:24 AM] Nexagon#6069
and the cat shat on me


[03-Apr-22 05:24 AM] Nexagon#6069
in my sleep


[03-Apr-22 05:24 AM] Nexagon#6069
like 4 or 5 hours ago


[03-Apr-22 05:25 AM] Nexagon#6069
dont make it fully like control points


[03-Apr-22 05:26 AM] Nexagon#6069
so people dont go capturing spawn regions


[03-Apr-22 05:26 AM] Nexagon#6069
make it not say anything


[03-Apr-22 05:26 AM] Nexagon#6069
color is enough


[03-Apr-22 05:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
too bright


[03-Apr-22 05:28 AM] Nexagon#6069
make it transparent


[03-Apr-22 05:28 AM] Nexagon#6069
i guess like that


[03-Apr-22 05:28 AM] Nexagon#6069
but it looks too much like a control point


[03-Apr-22 05:29 AM] Nexagon#6069
i fucking understna


[03-Apr-22 05:31 AM] Nexagon#6069
make it all a lot fainter so it looks less important than the control point


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
that looks bad


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
put in the middle facing up


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
and maybe make it a fly


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
like a fly icon


[03-Apr-22 05:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
for ship


[03-Apr-22 05:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
maybe just put an arrow instead


[03-Apr-22 05:36 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can put lines along the border like a cursor for decoration iguess


[03-Apr-22 05:37 AM] Nexagon#6069
all buttons fully functional now


[03-Apr-22 05:38 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 05:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[03-Apr-22 05:40 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 05:40 AM] Nexagon#6069

[03-Apr-22 05:41 AM] Nexagon#6069
make it different ships for red


[03-Apr-22 05:44 AM] Nexagon#6069
rock tower


[03-Apr-22 05:44 AM] Nexagon#6069

Alright, the channel is #rules-roles. What would you like the message to say? Use a | to separate the title from the description, like so
 ```This is a title | this is the description```
You can also type `{roles}` to have it replaced with a list of each emoji and its associated role.

[03-Apr-22 12:49 PM] Carl-bot#1536
Alright, I got a title and a description, would you like the message to have a color? Respond with the hex code or 'none' to skip.
Not sure what a hex code is? Check out <https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/>.


[03-Apr-22 12:49 PM] Nexagon#6069
none


[03-Apr-22 12:49 PM] Carl-bot#1536
Alright, the message will look like this. Next up we will add roles
The format for adding roles is emoji then the name of the role. When you're done, type 'done'
**Example:** ```:smile: league of legends```

That does not seem to be an emoji. If you insist that it is, make sure you don't have any other bots deleting messages from either of us. **Type 'done' to save and finish** or 'cancel' to discard everything.

Hello. Which channel would you like the message to be in?


[03-Apr-22 12:52 PM] Nexagon#6069
#rules-roles


[03-Apr-22 12:52 PM] Carl-bot#1536
Alright, the channel is #rules-roles. What would you like the message to say? Use a | to separate the title from the description, like so
 ```This is a title | this is the description```
You can also type `{roles}` to have it replaced with a list of each emoji and its associated role.


[03-Apr-22 12:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
select your region | pick your region; 🇪🇺 for EU, 🇺🇸 for US


[03-Apr-22 12:53 PM] Carl-bot#1536
Alright, I got a title and a description, would you like the message to have a color? Respond with the hex code or 'none' to skip.
Not sure what a hex code is? Check out <https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/>.


[03-Apr-22 12:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
none


[03-Apr-22 12:53 PM] Carl-bot#1536
Alright, the message will look like this. Next up we will add roles
The format for adding roles is emoji then the name of the role. When you're done, type 'done'
**Example:** ```:smile: league of legends```

is it good enough to be the a10 with some changes

which one gets which ability


[04-Apr-22 04:06 AM] Nexagon#6069
and firing pattern


[04-Apr-22 04:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
i want to make mine a stealth ability


[04-Apr-22 04:08 AM] Nexagon#6069
yours doesnt look stealthy


[04-Apr-22 04:09 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can give them to the player


[04-Apr-22 04:09 AM] Nexagon#6069
but not spawn them in activated state


[04-Apr-22 04:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
aliens exist


[04-Apr-22 04:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
that would be underpowered


[04-Apr-22 04:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
i could do that


[04-Apr-22 04:13 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can


[04-Apr-22 04:13 AM] Nexagon#6069
i can


[04-Apr-22 04:13 AM] Nexagon#6069
like a spectator


[04-Apr-22 04:13 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can make it idle


[04-Apr-22 04:13 AM] Nexagon#6069
and it becomes completely invisible


[04-Apr-22 04:14 AM] Nexagon#6069
thats gonna be the only weakness


[04-Apr-22 04:14 AM] Nexagon#6069

[04-Apr-22 04:17 AM] Nexagon#6069
its gonna be like the advanced fighter of small stealth planes


[04-Apr-22 04:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
i think thatll just be annoying


[04-Apr-22 04:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
if they can see the cursor they can just not go there


[04-Apr-22 04:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
and wait for it to expire


[04-Apr-22 04:21 AM] Nexagon#6069
how


[04-Apr-22 04:24 AM] Nexagon#6069

what is your idea


[04-Apr-22 06:28 AM] Nexagon#6069
my idea is it has a very small range and if you use the ability with an enemy in that range it drains its health and heals yours slowly

because we want to add more t6s


[04-Apr-22 08:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
because that would be code 610


[04-Apr-22 08:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
and thats taken by chimera


[04-Apr-22 08:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
even without any model


[04-Apr-22 08:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
we wont be able to have more than 20 ships then


[04-Apr-22 08:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
6.5 is good


[04-Apr-22 08:08 AM] Nexagon#6069
we can add 50 ships with 50 abilities

[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
for that


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can make it


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
right now its size 60


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
do 80


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
you cant go t7 now


[04-Apr-22 08:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[04-Apr-22 08:34 AM] Nexagon#6069
i think a 1 pixel wide circle is better than 0 fps every time you switch


[04-Apr-22 08:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
i dont know how to make it not lag


[04-Apr-22 08:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
you will if youre not using mouse


[04-Apr-22 08:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
people will complain about the lag


[04-Apr-22 08:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
itll take a long time


[04-Apr-22 08:35 AM] Nexagon#6069
ask bh about lag from turning visibility off on ui


[04-Apr-22 08:37 AM] Nexagon#6069

[04-Apr-22 08:46 AM] Nexagon#6069
i see


[04-Apr-22 08:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
probably both


[04-Apr-22 08:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
make the center area extra large and empty for the bigger control point


[04-Apr-22 08:48 AM] Nexagon#6069
8 spots of empty space in a radius should be enough


[04-Apr-22 08:48 AM] Nexagon#6069
so a circle with radius 8 in the middle absent of any rocks


[04-Apr-22 08:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
and whatever around it


[04-Apr-22 08:50 AM] Nexagon#6069

[04-Apr-22 08:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[04-Apr-22 08:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
not anything else i'm struggling with


[04-Apr-22 08:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
ill dm him when i need it


[04-Apr-22 08:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
send me his discord tag


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
let me check hold up


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
that should be the size


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
make the asteroids right next to the edge really dense and big


[04-Apr-22 08:53 AM] Nexagon#6069
so its hard to go through them


[04-Apr-22 08:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
put some rocks in the middle too dont make it too empty


[04-Apr-22 08:55 AM] Nexagon#6069
you have a high chance of being inaccurate there


[04-Apr-22 08:55 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[04-Apr-22 08:55 AM] Nexagon#6069
it works by multiplying


[04-Apr-22 08:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
no i mean the bases are placed on a very specific set of coordinates


[04-Apr-22 08:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
i can try


[04-Apr-22 09:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
no thats just annoying


[04-Apr-22 09:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
big holes


[04-Apr-22 09:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[04-Apr-22 09:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
bigger holes


[04-Apr-22 09:03 AM] Nexagon#6069
thats enough

yes


[04-Apr-22 09:07 AM] Nexagon#6069

everything around the point

[05-Apr-22 09:57 AM] Nexagon#6069
dont make the wing edges face straight up


[05-Apr-22 09:57 AM] Nexagon#6069
add more angle to the wings


[05-Apr-22 09:57 AM] Nexagon#6069
and size


[05-Apr-22 09:58 AM] Nexagon#6069
width


[05-Apr-22 10:04 AM] Nexagon#6069
change the back


[05-Apr-22 10:04 AM] Nexagon#6069
there is a body sticking out


[05-Apr-22 10:04 AM] Nexagon#6069
give the main body  a propeller


[05-Apr-22 10:05 AM] Nexagon#6069
and remove the thing in the middle


[05-Apr-22 10:08 AM] Nexagon#6069

[05-Apr-22 10:08 AM] Nexagon#6069
more joints


[05-Apr-22 10:12 AM] Nexagon#6069

[05-Apr-22 10:12 AM] Nexagon#6069
theyre good


[05-Apr-22 10:14 AM] Nexagon#6069
dont make them smaller


[05-Apr-22 10:14 AM] Nexagon#6069
they need to be big thrusters because the ship is fast


[05-Apr-22 10:18 AM] Nexagon#6069
give it bigger thrusters

[05-Apr-22 10:41 AM] Nexagon#6069
the goku image is a placeholder


[05-Apr-22 10:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
make that scorp face downards and make it as big as the circle


[05-Apr-22 10:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
and make it transparent


[05-Apr-22 10:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
like a single big scorp


[05-Apr-22 10:43 AM] Nexagon#6069
put the scorp there anayway


[05-Apr-22 10:44 AM] Nexagon#6069
make everything more transparent


[05-Apr-22 10:45 AM] Nexagon#6069
i said more


[05-Apr-22 10:45 AM] Nexagon#6069
so you could see everything through it


[05-Apr-22 10:45 AM] Nexagon#6069
so it doesnt block your vision


[05-Apr-22 10:46 AM] Nexagon#6069
that would mess with the control points


[05-Apr-22 10:46 AM] Nexagon#6069
i tried


[05-Apr-22 10:52 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[05-Apr-22 10:52 AM] Nexagon#6069
now make the red one


[05-Apr-22 10:54 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:32 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:32 AM] Nexagon#6069
make the whole settimeout on one line


[06-Apr-22 04:32 AM] Nexagon#6069
without removing text


[06-Apr-22 04:32 AM] Nexagon#6069
like that


[06-Apr-22 04:32 AM] Nexagon#6069
now change the type to 614


[06-Apr-22 04:33 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:37 AM] Nexagon#6069
just give me the code ill do it faster


[06-Apr-22 04:37 AM] Nexagon#6069
you wont learn anything from this


[06-Apr-22 04:37 AM] Nexagon#6069
ok well go to the very top of the code


[06-Apr-22 04:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
scroll down until you see abilitycooldowns


[06-Apr-22 04:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
add 714 there and give it the same cooldown as h-merc


[06-Apr-22 04:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
now add 714 to specialabilities


[06-Apr-22 04:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
below


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
above


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
not ehre


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
above


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
now go down to this.tick


[06-Apr-22 04:39 AM] Nexagon#6069
scroll down until you see a lot of yellow strings


[06-Apr-22 04:40 AM] Nexagon#6069
thats where all the ability names are stored


[06-Apr-22 04:40 AM] Nexagon#6069
add 714 there and give it the same name as h-mercs


[06-Apr-22 04:40 AM] Nexagon#6069
now go to this.event


[06-Apr-22 04:40 AM] Nexagon#6069
and you know what to do


[06-Apr-22 04:40 AM] Nexagon#6069
now it should work


[06-Apr-22 04:41 AM] Nexagon#6069
abilitycooldowns


[06-Apr-22 04:41 AM] Nexagon#6069
and increase it for both


[06-Apr-22 04:41 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
now just increase it


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
it stays in the mode for 15 seconds


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
what you set it to


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
no


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
this is the cooldown of the ability


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
it has nothing to do with how long it lasts


[06-Apr-22 04:42 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[06-Apr-22 04:43 AM] Nexagon#6069
then add 15 seconds to the cooldown?


[06-Apr-22 04:43 AM] Nexagon#6069
and no code cluttering needed


[06-Apr-22 04:44 AM] Nexagon#6069
go this.event and change 606s ability to abilityAsteroid()


[06-Apr-22 04:44 AM] Nexagon#6069
and that should do it for rock tower


[06-Apr-22 04:45 AM] Nexagon#6069
change the name


[06-Apr-22 04:45 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:45 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:46 AM] Nexagon#6069

[06-Apr-22 04:46 AM] Nexagon#6069
now switch the names of 606 and 603


[06-Apr-22 04:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
should be it


[06-Apr-22 04:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
now change the cooldowns


[06-Apr-22 04:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
you were right on it


[06-Apr-22 04:47 AM] Nexagon#6069
below


[06-Apr-22 04:48 AM] Nexagon#6069
you forgot to remove the shiptree.push for rock tower


[06-Apr-22 04:48 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes but we dont have a 703 right now


[06-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
this doesnt matter


[06-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
dont change anything here


[06-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[06-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
ok now try it


[06-Apr-22 04:49 AM] Nexagon#6069
this is leftovers from randomizer mod

[06-Apr-22 04:53 AM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 09:05 AM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 09:05 AM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 09:58 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 09:58 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 10:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
it looks weird


[07-Apr-22 10:03 AM] Nexagon#6069
but what about the artillery


[07-Apr-22 10:03 AM] Nexagon#6069
what about the cursor


[07-Apr-22 10:06 AM] Nexagon#6069
but what about the airstrike ship


[07-Apr-22 10:06 AM] Nexagon#6069
ok


[07-Apr-22 10:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
whats that


[07-Apr-22 10:07 AM] Nexagon#6069
its a name for the company no


[07-Apr-22 10:08 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 10:08 AM] Nexagon#6069
4000


[07-Apr-22 10:09 AM] Nexagon#6069
40000 it can shoot through the earths core


[07-Apr-22 10:10 AM] Nexagon#6069
oh that


[07-Apr-22 10:10 AM] Nexagon#6069
its a shrapnel cannon


[07-Apr-22 10:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
itll be hard to make it shoot properly


[07-Apr-22 10:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
bullets disappear automatically after a certain distance


[07-Apr-22 10:13 AM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 10:15 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 10:16 AM] Nexagon#6069
try tht


[07-Apr-22 10:17 AM] Nexagon#6069
make the texture 8 longer


[07-Apr-22 10:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
wait we should make the scope its ability


[07-Apr-22 10:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
without using its ability the anchor is normal in the middle


[07-Apr-22 10:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
but if you use the ability the ship cant turn and the anchor point is really far


[07-Apr-22 10:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
so its literally a scope


[07-Apr-22 10:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
then your whole ship would strafe


[07-Apr-22 10:22 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 10:22 AM] Nexagon#6069
would be better if it could become slightly more agile


[07-Apr-22 10:23 AM] Nexagon#6069
so its not just useless close range all the time


[07-Apr-22 10:24 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes i think it should


[07-Apr-22 10:26 AM] Nexagon#6069
its good


[07-Apr-22 10:37 AM] Nexagon#6069
angle


[07-Apr-22 10:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
not with wings


[07-Apr-22 10:38 AM] Nexagon#6069
probably


[07-Apr-22 10:57 AM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 12:44 PM] Nexagon#6069
i can but why


[07-Apr-22 12:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
thats because there are only 2 players


[07-Apr-22 12:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
i cant put badges on there


[07-Apr-22 12:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
i dont know how


[07-Apr-22 12:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
are badges on sdc leaderboard


[07-Apr-22 12:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
i cant make it normal because then gems would show


[07-Apr-22 12:46 PM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 03:48 PM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 03:50 PM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 04:39 PM] Nexagon#6069

more separate from the texture 2

[07-Apr-22 05:38 PM] Nexagon#6069
that looks good


[07-Apr-22 05:38 PM] Nexagon#6069
like it is now


[07-Apr-22 05:39 PM] Nexagon#6069
make the edge cannons further apart


[07-Apr-22 05:39 PM] Nexagon#6069
theyre too close together


[07-Apr-22 05:39 PM] Nexagon#6069
thats good then


[07-Apr-22 05:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[07-Apr-22 05:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
circle


[07-Apr-22 05:45 PM] Nexagon#6069
yes but its gonna be able to rotate 360 quickly


[07-Apr-22 05:46 PM] Nexagon#6069
and the circle one has more detail


[07-Apr-22 05:50 PM] Nexagon#6069
i think its good like this


[07-Apr-22 05:50 PM] Nexagon#6069
but add something on the bottom


[07-Apr-22 05:51 PM] Nexagon#6069
like a support beam on the bottom


[07-Apr-22 05:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
yes so just in case a ship with 1000000 mass gets flipped we can see that


[07-Apr-22 05:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
10000


[07-Apr-22 05:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
1e+300 is too much


[07-Apr-22 05:53 PM] Nexagon#6069
it might get moved but not too much


[07-Apr-22 05:54 PM] Nexagon#6069
we dont want people bouncing off this thing too fast


[07-Apr-22 05:54 PM] Nexagon#6069

[07-Apr-22 06:07 PM] Nexagon#6069
it will work


[07-Apr-22 06:07 PM] Nexagon#6069
make the acceleration high


[07-Apr-22 06:07 PM] Nexagon#6069
because it drifts


[07-Apr-22 06:07 PM] Nexagon#6069
because it has low acceleration


[07-Apr-22 06:07 PM] Nexagon#6069
give it high acceleration and itll stay in place

@Nexagon is there now 5 seconds between a team winning and the game ending


[10-Apr-22 09:26 AM] Thuliux#9764
it doesn’t feel right if the game ends immediately


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
should it make everyone idle


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
and it automatically ends


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Thuliux#9764
Yeah


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
after a few seconds


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
ok


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Thuliux#9764
you know how in crossout it has the victory screen


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Thuliux#9764
have something like that


[10-Apr-22 09:27 AM] Thuliux#9764
and it stops you from moving so yeah idle


[10-Apr-22 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
no


[10-Apr-22 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
let everyone kill each other


[10-Apr-22 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
like last 5 seconds thing


[10-Apr-22 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
making everyone idle would be gay


[10-Apr-22 09:29 AM] Nexagon#6069
i dont want to add more ui


[10-Apr-22 09:29 AM] Nexagon#6069
the 80% warning should be enough


[10-Apr-22 09:29 AM] Nexagon#6069
that would be laggy


[10-Apr-22 09:31 AM] Thuliux#9764
nah come on


[10-Apr-22 09:31 AM] Thuliux#9764
just a bit of text saying “Your team wins!” Or “Your team lost!”


[10-Apr-22 10:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
so should i make it give you a random ship when you spawn for the first time


[10-Apr-22 10:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
instead of just a-speed


[10-Apr-22 10:24 AM] Nexagon#6069

even if i dont get anything it was still fun making this

well I'm just gonna say, don't get your hopes up


[12-Apr-22 12:20 PM] Thuliux#9764
people who have ucp currently have done way way more than just get a mod in the game


[12-Apr-22 12:21 PM] Thuliux#9764
I'd say if you were to get one you'd need 2 or 3 solid mods in the game, and that aint easy

I think it should switch with the person closest to the angle you are looking in

no

to use the ability properly you have to look away from your opponent

for the ekho say something like "it sacrifices the engine in order to power the shield generators"

You guys went in against the approved politics from the corporations in view of Wolfan and Glitch, is your account okay?


[15-Jun-22 07:05 PM] Carme#8372
My expectations have been dashed, I can't run my laptop on the inverter for solar power available to me during the day, it overheats, and I mostly sleep at night proper.


[15-Jun-22 07:07 PM] Carme#8372
But I have been meaning to develop a mod for a long time and once again it's probably not happening.

Don't forget 
for (let ship of game.ships) to define "ship"

[13-Oct-22 07:33 AM] Nexagon#6069
@Deleted User energy cap * (ability cooldown - 1)


[13-Oct-22 07:33 AM] Nexagon#6069

[13-Oct-22 07:45 AM] Nexagon#6069

[13-Oct-22 07:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
yes


[13-Oct-22 08:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
does warthog need a buff


[13-Oct-22 08:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
it gets destroyed in clan wars


[13-Oct-22 08:01 AM] Nexagon#6069
maybe increase the speed of the cannons


[13-Oct-22 08:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
and thatll be good enough


[13-Oct-22 08:02 AM] Nexagon#6069
bullet speed


[13-Oct-22 08:03 AM] Nexagon#6069
bfg also seems to die easily in clan wars


[13-Oct-22 08:03 AM] Nexagon#6069
but i dont know if we should change it or not


[13-Oct-22 08:04 AM] Nexagon#6069
reaper is just objectively better in clan wars


[13-Oct-22 08:11 AM] Nexagon#6069
does mosquit or its ability need any changes


[13-Oct-22 08:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
should the warthog's ability be changed (cooldown or duration)


[13-Oct-22 08:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
or is it good


[13-Oct-22 08:54 AM] Nexagon#6069
increase the damage to 9 per cannon

~~i would spam that when get choo choo'd~~


[15-Oct-22 04:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
good idea


[15-Oct-22 04:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
another idea is "ability"


[15-Oct-22 04:50 AM] Nexagon#6069
so you can say when your ability is ready or not


[15-Oct-22 04:51 AM] Nexagon#6069
"ability yes" "ability no" "ability attack/defend"


[15-Oct-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
too complicated


[15-Oct-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
just "ready"


[15-Oct-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
is good enough


[15-Oct-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
so you can say "ready ?"


[15-Oct-22 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
and the teammate can say either yes or no


[15-Oct-22 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
no need for there to be 5 extra emotes, only 1 is good enough


[15-Oct-22 04:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
you can also put any emoji


[15-Oct-22 04:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
just add the checkmark and make it say "ready"


[15-Oct-22 07:35 AM] Edward_72#7713

What do you mean when you say the server got locked?


[21-Oct-22 09:30 AM] Thuliux#9764
I think servers have a data limit in order to protect themselves


[21-Oct-22 09:30 AM] Thuliux#9764
I opened random servers which involved sending 70 megabytes per second through UI components and the servers got locked in seconds


[21-Oct-22 09:31 AM] Thuliux#9764
because, a little trolling


[22-Oct-22 09:19 AM] Nexagon#6069
intervention should really be nerfed


[22-Oct-22 09:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
even one hit from it wipes your health out and pushes you away


[22-Oct-22 09:20 AM] Nexagon#6069
it's the meta in clan wars


[22-Oct-22 09:26 AM] Nexagon#6069
do you think we should nerf the valkyrie, reaper, piercer, intervention meta @Deleted User


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Edward_72#7713
mb the cd should be bit longer


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
less rotation and health


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
i think


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Edward_72#7713
what mode?


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Nexagon#6069
both


[22-Oct-22 09:27 AM] Edward_72#7713
ok


[22-Oct-22 09:29 AM] Edward_72#7713
also reaper is very balanced because of the long cooldown, extremely low mobility


[22-Oct-22 09:29 AM] Edward_72#7713
and basically no ability


[22-Oct-22 09:30 AM] Edward_72#7713
valkyrie attack mode mb less energy regen


[22-Oct-22 09:30 AM] Edward_72#7713
lex will whine if the piercer's nerfed, while i think it def. should be done


[22-Oct-22 11:21 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
i think zeus need a nerf, the ability is fine, but the shots are strong


[22-Oct-22 11:21 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
i can stun every time to the enemy


[22-Oct-22 11:22 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
and he cant aim


[22-Oct-22 12:20 PM] Megalodon#0001
no its easy to counter with a ship like condor


[22-Oct-22 12:41 PM] Edward_72#7713
blunderbuss needs more pellets in both ability and standard


[22-Oct-22 12:41 PM] Nexagon#6069

host only one a day maximum


[10-Nov-22 03:21 PM] Megalodon#0001
even that is too much


[10-Nov-22 03:21 PM] Megalodon#0001
one game every 2 days


[10-Nov-22 03:21 PM] Megalodon#0001
or no one will get hyped for it anymore


[10-Nov-22 03:21 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
oh, i cant host one public and one ranked per day?, (except the weekends)


[10-Nov-22 03:21 PM] Megalodon#0001
the weekends lets do one per day


[10-Nov-22 03:22 PM] Megalodon#0001
but during the week keep it one game every 2 days


[10-Nov-22 03:22 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
the weekends?


[10-Nov-22 03:23 PM] Megalodon#0001
yes


[10-Nov-22 03:23 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
for me its better in the week, 1 and in the weekend maximun 3, how about that?


[10-Nov-22 03:23 PM] Megalodon#0001
no no


[10-Nov-22 03:23 PM] Megalodon#0001
during the week keep it 1 game every 2 days


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] Megalodon#0001
and okay during the weekends do 2 games a day


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] Megalodon#0001
but don't host too much during the week


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] Megalodon#0001
or just spread the host


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] Megalodon#0001
even more


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] Megalodon#0001
or make a day of arena mod


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] Megalodon#0001
like 6 games one day


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] Megalodon#0001
and 2 or 3 spread around the week


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
i prefer the first one


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] Megalodon#0001
so you host alot one day


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] Megalodon#0001
and then almost no more during the week


[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161

[10-Nov-22 03:25 PM] Megalodon#0001

[16-Nov-22 04:12 PM] Nexagon#6069

[17-Nov-22 10:04 AM] Nexagon#6069

is fragile, but u can dodge and go more fast, and thats gives the advantage to fight 2 people, but the ability is created to be the destroyer of all, (the counter is advanced fighter ability)

[10-Dec-22 10:27 AM] Carme#8372
peak footwork with the AMTM Pulse makes me think of the bit of a Manwha I read long ago called "The Breaker" where a kid is taught how to fight and a major component was how to step so that he wouldn't get hit or be in a position to attack swiftly, something vaguely like that.


[10-Dec-22 11:27 AM] Carme#8372
Has this been considered before?

short cooldown, directional emp?


[10-Dec-22 11:29 AM] Carme#8372
shoot a cone of emp at people because a long cooldown for a short effect with short range that probably won't get all of the people it needs to, is frustrating enough to the right person that the advanced fighter gets targeted immediately (not that strategy is bad, mind you)


[10-Dec-22 11:29 AM] Carme#8372
the frustration of being emp'd and the frustration of not having one when you need it are affecting the ship from the player and their adversary


[10-Dec-22 11:30 AM] Carme#8372
originally the emp drained the ship, I don't know if it still does that, I wasn't paying especially close attention

I don't keep up, has Discord done it again?


[25-Dec-22 06:32 PM] Carme#8372
@Xerxes Discord ate another account?
Can I see how the area of effect for Advanced Fighter works?

```js
abilityEMP = function(ship){
  myTeam = ship.team
  let affectedships = findClosestPlayer(ship,45)[1]
  abilityPull(ship,-0.2,80)
  ship.set({vx:getFrontPosition(-0.3,ship.x,ship.y,ship.r)[0]-ship.x+ship.vx/1.5,vy:getFrontPosition(-0.3,ship.x,ship.y,ship.r)[1]-ship.y+ship.vy/1.5,invulnerable:100})
  damageShip(ship,150)
  for (Qship of affectedships){
    if (Qship.team != myTeam){
      Qship.set({idle:true})
      damageShip(Qship,100)
      Qship.custom.EMP = true
      Qship.custom.inAbility = true}}
  setTimeout( () => {
    for (Qship of game.ships){
        if (Qship.custom.EMP) { Qship.set({idle:false,generator:0}) }
        else { Qship.set({idle:false}) }
        Qship.custom.EMP = false
        Qship.custom.inAbility = false}
  }, 5000 )}
```

Huh, this doesn't that I read it, indicate what the affected area indicator renders as and such


[25-Dec-22 06:35 PM] Carme#8372
I guess there's more ability logic that I don't know how to ask for without asking for stuff you're probably not going to share


[25-Dec-22 06:37 PM] Carme#8372
however this bit `findClosestPlayer` I guess originally EMP hit everyone in the circle, right? I was wondering why AMTM duo didn't really go hard using EMP to prepare a target for the crossbow

my brain meats have been in a mess because maybe I am just dumb or I need to go on some kind of retreat to delete all of my distractions from learning to code...
Do you use a Pythagorean formula to use/ produce a hypotenuse for purposes of identifying ship positions relative to other ships?
What other methods do you think would work?

@Nexagon


[06-Jan-23 02:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
i literally googled "calculate distance between 2 points in 2d space"


[06-Jan-23 02:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
or something like that


[06-Jan-23 02:56 AM] Nexagon#6069
i dont remember the formula


[06-Jan-23 11:28 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
@Xerxes im planning next weekend, host a AMTM, but depends on you if i can or not, if not, i see other ideas


[06-Jan-23 11:31 PM] Xerxes#4539
Sure


[12-Jan-23 08:27 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161

[12-Jan-23 09:18 AM] Megalodon#0001
i didn't even knew it was already in


[13-Jan-23 05:56 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
@Xerxes for curiosity i check the rock tower power in AMTM, and i was right, u launch gifts instead of rocks, that very op


[13-Jan-23 05:56 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
u can drop like 8 secondaries


[13-Jan-23 06:07 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
if u cant fix it, i will remove that for the event since can be too much OP


[14-Jan-23 09:30 AM] Megalodon#0001
You cannot remove that


[14-Jan-23 09:30 AM] Megalodon#0001
For SAW i'll speak about it to gilles


[14-Jan-23 11:02 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
well, in that case, people that will go that ship, thew will have a op ability


[14-Jan-23 11:03 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
unless its fixed


[14-Jan-23 11:41 AM] Megalodon#0001
I will see that with gilles to add an option in modding


[14-Jan-23 11:41 AM] Megalodon#0001
Atleast i'll try


[14-Jan-23 11:51 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
thank you, we hope gilles can do something with that


[14-Jan-23 12:06 PM] Megalodon#0001
He is lazy af so idk


[14-Jan-23 01:35 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
so what i can do to at least solve something with the rock tower ability?


[14-Jan-23 01:46 PM] Megalodon#0001
Well technically you can't do anything


[14-Jan-23 02:44 PM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
i see :/


[22-Jan-23 06:50 AM] Megalodon#0001
@Xerxes should i propose this mod to gilles ?


[22-Jan-23 06:50 AM] Megalodon#0001
It could work i've got contact with him recently


[22-Jan-23 06:51 AM] Nexagon#6069

[22-Jan-23 06:51 AM] Megalodon#0001
