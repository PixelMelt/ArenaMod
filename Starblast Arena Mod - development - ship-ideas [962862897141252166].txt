I am on a phone, discord is shit on phones


[20-Apr-22 09:45 PM] boris#9786
i just thought of an interesting ship ability


[20-Apr-22 09:46 PM] boris#9786
my ability idea is, if any enemy ships get inside of the ability radius and the ability gets activated, the enemy ships will be teleported back to their base


[20-Apr-22 09:46 PM] boris#9786
this is mainly used to keep enemies out of the point


[20-Apr-22 09:47 PM] boris#9786
cooldown could be 1 min or 1m 30s


[20-Apr-22 09:47 PM] boris#9786
its a simple concept, but i dont know if that will be able to work in the game


[20-Apr-22 09:47 PM] boris#9786
im pretty sure it would work


[20-Apr-22 11:55 PM] Nexagon#6069
thats literally the same as instantly killing them


[20-Apr-22 11:55 PM] Nexagon#6069

no


[20-Apr-22 11:55 PM] boris#9786

[20-Apr-22 11:55 PM] boris#9786

Am I crazy to think that it would be ideal for all of the ship variety to be pruned down into batches to rotate through?


[11-Oct-22 06:26 PM] Carme#8372
so that meta ships can fight each other instead of complete madness?

[07-Nov-22 09:18 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
And for this one, instead of the x button, will be left click


[07-Nov-22 09:24 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161

Or play with the u-sniper with a ability üòÆ


[07-Nov-22 09:28 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
For this one, the time to use can be 45 seconds maybe


[07-Nov-22 09:28 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
or more


[07-Nov-22 09:30 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
or imagine a power that can reduce the damage to the enemy, 
Example: 50% less damage


[07-Nov-22 09:30 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
like weakness for the enemy


[07-Nov-22 09:31 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
And a ship that gives strenght to the allies


[07-Nov-22 09:31 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
or only 1 allie


[07-Nov-22 09:32 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
example: 25% more damage


[07-Nov-22 09:32 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
and 10% more speed


[07-Nov-22 09:32 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
and 10% too to speed bullet


[07-Nov-22 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
these are all very good ideas (except the fly, fuck you.) however, most of them are impossible to create due to how limited starblast modding is. I really like the sound of an asteroid machine gun, but you cannot turn bullets into asteroids, if this were the case I would have made an alien machine gun long ago.

and for the abilities such as more damage 'strength' and 'weakness' we would have to duplicate every ship code and change the stats of it.

for example you want to give 'weakness' to an advanced fighter, we would have to add an advanced fighter that has less energy regen/capacity


[07-Nov-22 11:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
that means we would have to DOUBLE the number of ship codes we have, resulting in a very heavy mod.


[07-Nov-22 11:03 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
Ooh i see


[07-Nov-22 11:04 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
That will take much time üò¨


[07-Nov-22 11:47 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
But for asteroids, is not possible to launch mini rocks by pressing many times the button to shoot rocks?


[07-Nov-22 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
i mean theoretically


[07-Nov-22 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
we could just make the entire screen a big invisible button


[07-Nov-22 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
and whenever you click (LMB) you actually click the button


[07-Nov-22 11:50 AM] BYLOLOPRO360#6161
Well, u will try that for season 3 or u will think of that later?

[10-Dec-22 10:12 AM] Carme#8372
Strafe, lacking an actual name, is a ship that shoots sideways, using a device like the artillery thing does to aim because it doesn't aim on cursor.


[10-Dec-22 10:12 AM] Carme#8372
its ability has an instant cooldown and switches the side the gun shoots out of


[10-Dec-22 10:12 AM] Carme#8372
so that it can come about and keep shooting


[10-Dec-22 10:14 AM] Carme#8372
The idea is that withoutenabling strafing, it behaves like it can strafe.


[10-Dec-22 10:15 AM] Carme#8372
it shoots and flies perpendicularly so that it isn't 'drifting' and shooting, it is 'strafing' and shooting


[21-Dec-22 10:21 PM] Edward_72#7713
a silencer "assassin" ship that uses a barrage of quick damage 1 lasers

speaking of which we have to add it to other arena versions


[22-Dec-22 11:02 AM] Edward_72#7713
is it in team mode?


[23-Dec-22 08:00 AM] Nexagon#6069
